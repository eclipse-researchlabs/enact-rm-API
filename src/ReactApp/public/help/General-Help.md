# Welcome to Beawre Risk Control

Efficient construction project design and execution depends on many different aspects including conforming to strict regulations and coordination of different stakeholders, tight budgets and strict deadlines. In particular, management of construction documents is an unavoidable and complex part of any project. Poor documentation control can lead to costly mistakes in execution. For example, a change in the project schedule may impact important deadlines, subcontractors may be late or they may not deliver expected quality, or clients may take longer than expected to review and approve documents.

All these aspects make it challenging to control the risks associated with documentation management. This is generally aggravated by the widespread use of spreadsheets that require manual management and generate processes that are prone to human error. Beawre Document Risk Control provides a smart solution to help you control risks related to documentation control.

With Beawre Risk Control, we acknowledge that managing risks in complex processes involving different stakeholders and platforms is difficult and we tackle three main challenges:

- Control of activities owned by third parties
- Software tools which are not prepared to support decision-making processes
- Lack of interoperability between software platforms.

## Summary of main features

Find out the main features that will help your organization optimize documentation review and approval processes. With Beawre Risk Control tools, you can efficiently control your work procedures, your projects and your organization.

- **Control subcontractors and efficiently coordinate with your client**: See clearly if there is a risk of a subcontractor delivering documents late or if your customer is taking too long to approve documents using historical data.
- **Prioritize work based on the level of risk and focus on relevant tasks**: What are the most risky documents I should be focusing on? Our algorithms automatically calculate the level of risk per document and show it in the documentation schedule.

Connect tools through our portal and have global control of the impact of changes in the documentation schedule or the consequences of delays in any document.
- **Build the documentation schedule collaboratively with subcontractors**: Replace difficult-to-trace e-mail conversations and multiple spreadsheet versions with our collaborative options to help your subcontractor build their documentation schedules with you.
- **Leverage AI to enable smart analytics and prediction**: Learn from your past activity and data and be better prepared for decision making. Use information to keep your subcontractors accountable. Leverage machine learning techniques to predict the future, anticipate unwanted situations and mitigate risks and potential negative impact.
- **Get automatic alerts to help you mitigate risks as soon as possible**: Receive automated alerts in the form of messages or e-mails under defined circumstances where documentation preparation may jeopardize project execution. Decide whether you want to receive them daily or in weekly summaries.

## Overall overview of the application

Beawre Risk Control is offered as Software-as-a-Service (SaaS). This means that the application is hosted by Beawre and is accessible online. Because our business model is based in SaaS, users do not need to install any tools in their system. This also makes maintenance easy and transparent to users. Whenever a new feature or improvement is added to Beawre Risk Control, users do not need to perform any action on their local machines. When they log in to the system, they will be able to see and use the new features instantly.

### Landing page and Views

When you connect to Beawre Risk Control, the default landing page is the operational dashboard. However, there are other views that will help you to control risks holistically. The different views are organized in tabs that users can find in the top of the application.

In particular, there are five different tabs:

- **Home**: this is the landing page which shows the operational dashboard. Find more information about the operational dashboard [here](https://gitlab.com/beawre/pro/vfr-documentation/-/wikis/Operational-Dashboard).
- **Documents**: this view is used to visualize the documentation schedule. Find more information about the "Documents" tab [here](https://gitlab.com/beawre/pro/vfr-documentation/-/wikis/Documents).
- **Tasks**: this view is used to show tasks from the project schedule. Find more information about the "Tasks" tab [here](https://gitlab.com/beawre/pro/vfr-documentation/-/wikis/Tasks-in-the-Project-Schedule).
- **Subcontractors**: this view is used to list subcontractors and the most relevant metrics about them. Find more information about the "Subcontractors" tab [here](https://gitlab.com/beawre/pro/vfr-documentation/-/wikis/Subcontractors).

### Users and Roles

Beawre Risk Control allows an unlimited number of users to interact in order to efficiently manage the review and approval of documents. Different users may play different roles and observe different functionality in our solution.

Any organization will have a special user role with the rights to manage the organization: the Administrator. This role has privileges to manage all the other users. Apart from the Administrator there may be many other roles, such as VFR Owner, Document Controller, Project Controller, Project Management Team, Subcontractor, etc. Our tool allows the Administrator to define as many roles as necessary and define privileges for each role.

### Managing users and roles

As an administrator of the tool you may be able to manage users and roles. In order to do so, please select the option “Privileges Control” in the menu on the top right corner.

In the new view, you will see different subtabs:

- Users: in the `User` tab you will be able to manage users. As an administrator, you can see all the users assigned to you. For each user you can assign a group, branch, or link to a subcontractor. Please, see the next bullet points to know more about the meaning of each of these features.
- Groups: Groups are the mechanism Beawre Risk Control solution uses to assign privileges to users. Groups represent the different roles that may use the tool. As an administrator you can create as many groups as you need. Think about who needs to use the tool and what actions they need/should be allowed to do and create a group for each role. In the `Groups` tab you can create multiple groups and specify, for each one, what are the privileges that they need to have. Once you associate a user to a group, this user will inherit all the privileges of the group. Please, note that privileges cannot be assigned to a single user. If there is a user with a unique role such as the general director or quality department director who may need special access to different features, please create a group to represent this role and assign the user to the group.

### Notifications system

Beawre Risk Control solution provides a notification system to warn relevant stakeholders about different important events. The notification system is a risk mitigation mechanism. The objective of notifications is to raise awareness to users about relevant events that need to be considered to mitigate imminent risks.

The current Beawre Risk Control solution considers 5 different situations where notifications are sent:

- **The risk status of a document changes**: in particular any document changing from "Low risk" to "Medium Risk", "Medium Risk" to "High Risk" or "High Risk" to "Late" will generate a notification.
- **A new document is created**: the creation of a document will generate a notification.
- **The deadline of a task changes**: if the deadline of a document changes, the system will generate a notification. This usually happens when the project schedule is updated.
- **Client violates a document review deadline**: when the client takes more time than agreed by contract to review a document, the system will generate a notification.
- **A subcontractor has not submitted a document and the deadline indicates that the risk of not delivering on time grows**: the system will generate a notification when a document has not been received from the subcontractor and the risk status changes from "Low Risk" to "Medium Risk".

There are two mechanisms to receive notification:

- **Through e-mail**: Beawre Risk Control will send an e-mail to users when one of the previously defined events happens.
- **Through the embedded notification system**: Beawre Risk Control has a notification system. To see your notifications, click on the bell symbol in the top right corner.

Every user can customize the notification system. In order to customize your preferences, please unfold the notification menu by clicking on the bell symbol in the top right corner, and click on "Settings" in the right corner of the unfolded menu. For each type of notification, users can decide if they want to receive notifications by e-mail ("EMAIL"), through the embedded notification system ("WEBAPP"), both or none.
